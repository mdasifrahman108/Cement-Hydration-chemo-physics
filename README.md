# Cement-Hydration-chemo-physics

The addition of supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) to cement triggers a complex cement hydration system characterized by intricate mineral admixture interactions. This work develops EcoBlendNet, a novel physics-informed neural network (PINN), to analyze carbon emissions during SCM-enhanced cement hydration. EcoBlendNet integrates experimental data and the chemo-physical aspects of cement hydration in a heated cement paste, accurately predicting concrete maturity and compressive strength by capturing early-age temperature rises for various mixing blends, including Portland cement, cement-fly ash blends, and cement-slag blends. SCMs effectively reduce temperature rises without compromising strength development. The work illustrates a statistical method to efficiently leverage limited SCM resources for mitigating environmental impacts in concrete production. Quantitative analysis reveal that substituting 45-80% of cement with industrial fly ash and slag can reduce CO2 emissions by 60-80% during cement hydration. The validated EcoBlendNet offers a precise and interpretable tool for eco-friendly blend selection, harmonizing with experimental methods. Itâ€™s adaptable to different material properties and mineral admixtures, thereby promoting eco-friendly concrete development.
