# Cement-Hydration-chemo-physics

The addition of supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) to cement generates an intricate system of cement hydration, involving complex interactions among the mineral admixtures. In this work, an original physics-informed neural network (PINN) architecture PINN-Hydra is proposed, to enable a data-driven platform that investigates the chemo-physical behavior of SCMs during cement hydration. The PINN-Hydra architecture is trained on a heated cement paste, by simultaneously fitting the cement hydration experimental data and its underlying physics. The developed model accurately predicts concrete compressive strength by capturing the early-age temperature rise in cement paste for Portland cement, cement-fly ash blend, and cement-slag blend. SCMs can significantly reduce the temperature rise without compromising the strength gaining process. The validated PINN-Hydra model offers improved accuracy and interpretability, making it an attractive alternative to traditional finite element solvers. It can be calibrated with different materials properties and mineral admixtures, contributing to eco-friendly concrete, and mitigating environmental impact.
